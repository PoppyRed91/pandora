          Prometheus and Epimetheus, Titans who supported Zeus during his battle
          with the Titans, were given the task of creating creatures on Earth.
          Epimetheus crafted animals, giving each unique skills and protection.
          Prometheus shaped man but had no gifts left to give. Prometheus wanted
          to help mankind and asked Zeus for fire, but Zeus refused. Fire was
          only for the Gods. Defying Zeus, Prometheus took the fire and gave it
          to the humans.
